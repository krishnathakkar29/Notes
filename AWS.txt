#1 => Traditional Vs Cloud Computing 
Traditional Problem => Scalability expensive and timetaking and wastage of infrastructure

cloud computing services 
infra => aas , paas , saas => hardware and os EC2
paas => application and data manage karta hai AWS RDS
saas => kuch manage mat karo , khaali use karo service , gmail lekin apna data kahi aur rakha jayega 


types of cloud  => public pvt and hybrid 
public => you can access it over the internet , available for the world AWS , AZURE
(openstack) ?? open source cloud computing solution  , highly customizable 
PVT: A private cloud is a cloud environment that is exclusively used by a single organization
hybrid : combination of both 
So i am making a VPC in AWS right => first i am accessing it then i am making it isliye

#Create first EC2 instance
Bootstap script?
now AZ A for user1 and AZ A for user2 may be different in real

inbound => we send request to the server and outbound means server to the outside world
commands => 
free -m => see ram 
lscpu => no of cpus
df -h 
ip a => pvt ip address 

volume termination on instance deletion 
launch a bootstrap script => so the shell script always as a root user chalti hai and not ubuntu user

Security groups => you can only write allow ka rule and not deny ka , also yaa toh inbound(incoming) aur ya toh outbound instance par
you can attach multiple security groups to one instance
